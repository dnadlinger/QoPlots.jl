QuantumOptics.jl plots
======================

Plotting functions for density matrices, etc. from the QuantumOptics.jl
package.

Supported plot types:
 - `plot_dm()` plots a density matrix in a 2D plot inspired by Hinton diagrams,
 	where symbol size represents magnitude and colour represents phase.
 - `plot_bloch()` plots an array of 1-qubit density matrices on the Bloch sphere.
